\title{Run Dewey Download Using UV}
\usage{
dewey_download(
  api_key,
  folder_id,
  download_path = NULL,
  python_version = "3.13",
  num_workers = NULL,
  partition_key_before = NULL,
  partition_key_after = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{api_key}{Character string with the API key for deweypy authentication}

\item{folder_id}{Character string with the Dewey folder ID or URL to download from}

\item{download_path}{Character string specifying where to download files.
Default is a "dewey-downloads" folder in the current working directory.}

\item{python_version}{Character string specifying the Python version to use.
Default is "3.13". Must be a valid Python version supported by uv.
Python 3.14 is not compatible with deweypy as of this writing, so do not specify 3.14 or higher.}

\item{num_workers}{Integer specifying number of workers for multi-threaded downloads.
Default is NULL (uses deweypy's default of 8). Only modify if you have specific
performance requirements; most users should leave this unchanged.}

\item{partition_key_before}{Character string in YYYY-MM-DD format. If specified,
includes all partitions up to and including this date. Only relevant for
date-partitioned datasets. Leave NULL to download all data.}

\item{partition_key_after}{Character string in YYYY-MM-DD format. If specified,
includes all partitions from and including this date onward. Only relevant for
date-partitioned datasets. Leave NULL to download all data.}
}
\description{
Downloads files from a Dewey folder using uvx to run deweypy without requiring
a local Python installation or manual package management. This function automatically
handles uv installation if needed and executes the download in an isolated environment.
}
\details{
This function uses \href{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/}{uv} (a fast Python package installer)
to run deweypy without requiring you to manage Python environments manually.

The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Checks if uv is installed, and installs it if needed
\item Creates the download directory if it doesn't exist
\item Executes deweypy's speedy-download command via uvx in an isolated environment
}

The download progress will be displayed in real-time as the function executes.
}
\section{Note on UV Installation}{

If uv needs to be installed, you may see a message recommending you restart your
terminal for optimal performance in future runs. The function will work without
restarting, but subsequent runs may be faster after a restart.
}

\section{Advanced Options}{

The \code{num_workers}, \code{partition_key_before}, and \code{partition_key_after}
parameters are advanced options that most users won't need to modify. The default
settings work well for typical use cases.

# Basic usage with default settings
dewey_download(

# Specify custom download location
dewey_download(
  api_key = "your-api-key",

# Use a different Python version
dewey_download(

)

# Advanced: Multi-threaded download with 16 workers

  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "folder123",
  num_workers = 16
)

# Advanced: Download only partitions after a specific date

  api_key = "your-api-key",
  folder_id = "folder123",
  partition_key_after = "2024-01-01"
